      Within the growing amount of non-computer items with computing and internet connectivity capabilities, often called the Internet-of-Things (or IoT), there are growing concerns with these device’s security. Where computers and similar devices have had numerous years to grow and mature their security, to the point that there is an entire industry surrounding such security, devices within the IoT have not had such time, and are heavily lacking in security features. One of the most concerning IoT devices in regards to security are smart door locks, door locks that can be connected and manipulated via smart phone app, or internet connectivity. Smart locks are unique in the sense that they are the only IoT devices that bridge the gap between digital and physical security, a vulnerability within a smart lock is a vulnerability to one’s person and property directly.</p>

<p>IoT devices, and smart locks in specific, are very vulnerable to not only physical breaking and entering, but digital attacks as well. As claimed by Bapat and co. in their article “Smart-Lock Security Re-engineered using Cryptography and Steganography”, smart locking devices that use Bluetooth (nearly every smart lock on the market) are vulnerable to eavesdropping, Denial of Service attacks, and Man in the Middle attacks. Their security relies not only on the lock itself, but the device or devices connecting to it, creating a wide range of possible methods of attack and intrusion. Aside the risk of an intruder physically breaking the lock itself, there are the numerous risks of one accessing the user’s smart phone and/or the lock in question, creating double if not triple the security risks.</p>

<p>Such locking devices are not only a threat to one’s physical security, but ones emotional and mental wellbeing. Kirtley and Memmel wrote in their article “Too Smart for Its Own Good: Addressing the Privacy and Security Challenges of the Internet of Things,” that “On June 23, 2018, The New York Times interviewed more than 30 domestic abuse survivors, their lawyers, shelter workers, and emergency responders, who described experiences in which ‘Internet-connected locks… that ha[d] been marketed as the newest conveniences [were] now also being used as a means for harassment, monitoring, revenge[,] and control.’” (23) Individuals who have been previously given access to these devices, or those that find means to breach them, can make one feel unsafe within their own home. It is not a crime to unlock someone’s door remotely, no physical harm has been done, yet the emotional toll may be incredible.</p>

<p>As smart locks and other such IoT devices continue to age and mature, the industry they create will become more concerned with sophisticate security. Yet within the less than a decade old industry, most devices have not yet reached the level of security needed for devices that will separate yourself from the outside world. A consumer must be wary of leaving their personal security to a vulnerable device, and be very aware of the product there are using, should they wish not to hear unwanted footsteps entering their home. </p>
