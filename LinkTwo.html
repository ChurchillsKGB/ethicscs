    <h2>The Potential Threat of Smart Home Devices </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>	Because all Smart Home devices are not fully secured, one could be victim to identity theft, unwanted purchases, and burglaries. Someone could disable a home’s locks, alarm system, and turn security cameras off and break in completely unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>	These devices are quickly being upgraded and new installations; Amazon is working on integrating the smart home device, Alexa, into common kitchen appliances such as the oven, stove, and microwave; this would give the machine control over the temperatures and settings of the appliances.
</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>A perceptive using the Kantianism Philosophy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>•	Using the philosophy of Kantianism, one can justify why tech companies focus on the aspect of innovation of their smart home technology rather than focus on its security and privacy. Kantianism is the view that actions are morally right if they fulfill an individual duty. Some common goals that these tech companies have is: (1) to create an environment that allows humans to efficiently conserve energy, (2) to create at-home care options for elderly and disabled people and (3) to create technology that changes the world for the better.</li>
      <li>•	According to Kantianism, these tech companies are morally right because by creating these devices that have the ability to reduce and conserve energy in a home and help elderly or disabled people live less stressful lives, they are satisfying their overall responsibility. If these companies didn’t release devices until they were 100% non-hackable, they would fall behind and their duty would never be fulfilled. Instead of waiting, they take the risk that their devices are capable of being hacked into in exchange for making a person’s home environment a better place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Future of Smart Home Tech</h2>
    <p>With advancements in smart home technology, homes could be morphed into personalized medical care centers where disabled and elderly people can live relaxed and independent lifestyles in their own home rather than being surrounded by caregivers in unfamiliar environments that could have negatively impact their mental state.
Also, Smart Home companies are trying to produce technology that helps with energy sustainability and consumption in homes.
Although, tech companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Google are making progressive advancements that have the power to help many people and the earth, they should still be obligated to make sure their technology is secure and safe so that it doesn’t bring more harm than good into the world.
