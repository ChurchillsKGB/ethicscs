<h2 class="subheader">Major Security Issues of IoT Devices:</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>critical functionality (IoT devices are used in critical utility and communication grids);</li>
   <li>replication (devices are identical so finding one flaw can be used on all similar devices);</li>
   <li>security assumptions (device engineers assumed devices would not be targeted by hackers);</li>
   <li>difficulty in patching the device software;</li>
   <li>long life cycle;</li>
   <li>proprietary or industry specific protocols;</li>
   <li>and deployment outside the enterprise security perimeter</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The responsibility of securing these devices, both devices currently in use and the vast number of devices that will be purchased in the next decade, lies on the engineers and manufacturers of IoT devices; it is simply not technologically feasible to design a third-party security solution for the myriad of devices.</p>
 <p>In accordance with Social Contract Theory, while not acting illegally, these device manufacturers are acting immorally by violating consumersâ€™ rights to security and privacy, especially since consumers are not adequately informed of the dangers these devices pose.</p>
