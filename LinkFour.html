    <p>With the advancement and innovations of the Internet of Things, common homeowners are given the opportunity to automate or synchronize many of their common everyday items. Yet, with these new additions and implementations, there seems to be a scarcity of documentation as to how these devices operate. For one, Behmor, the manufactures of a “connected brewer,” state in a user manual the setup and usage of a wi-fi enabled coffeepot. It has basic setup instructions, many pages of “making the perfect brew,” and a handful of troubleshooting procedures. However, there are no instances of how the device interacts with other devices on the network. Although the manual states the device is connected and operated via the company’s app you download on a mobile, there is no visible expression as to how the device uses your network, the key element of the device (aside from the core mechanics). At the end of their EULA posted on their website, Behmor states they “may collect and use information gathered in any manner as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Behmor App. Behmor, Inc.” (Behmor). Of course, this specifically phrased statement of “data collection” leaves a massive grey area, especially in terms of “gathered in any manner.” Though the violation of personal privacy for corporate gain tugs at the collar of every person on the globe, the inept nature of humans in this day in age is to set and forget. In the Behmor example, the devices immediately in contact are the coffeemaker and the mobile device connected via the app. There is, of course, the connection to the internet via a wireless access point, a router, a modem, and voila. A minimum of three other devices are connected to the coffeemaker. Again, from the modem comes the connection to the Internet Service Provider, and down the rabbit hole. Without specifics, it is safe to conclude the data intended to transfer between the coffeemaker and the phone is required to pass through multiple “unrelated” channels, each with their own documentation of usage, each recording information, most of which will be handled elsewhere at the provider’s will.

    <p>With additional documentation as to how devices operate on networks comes increased versatility of people’s home network security. Manufacturers might have incentives to increase their built-in security as a marketing ploy, something that should come standard but is seriously lacking. Media outlets proclaim the dangers of network connected devices, such as “Hacked Home Devices Can Spy On You” from NBC, or “A hacker took over a baby monitor and broadcast threats” by the Washington Post. You would think with such a public outcry, the demand for better security would be greater, and the demand of information on how these wifi-connected home devices operate would increase. Yet, it is simple and sad to state the majority of common users would rather set and forget their devices, and live in fantasy, assuming their gadgets and devices are as secure as the locks on their front door. It is more common to find open printers and unprotected networks than an unlocked door, an open window, or a key under the welcome mat. With the inclusion of more devices comes the increased attack surface area, a liability to the homeowner, the ironic duet of increased physical security at the cost of nonphysical security. The best course of action for the implementation of better security should be the public presentation of device operations, the methods of security a device, and the documentation in relation.
