    <p>With the advancement and innovations of the Internet of Things, common homeowners are given the opportunity to automate or synchronize many of their common everyday items. Yet, with these new additions and implementations, there seems to be a scarcity of documentation as to how these devices operate. For one, Behmor, the manufactures of a “connected brewer,” state in a user manual the setup and usage of a wi-fi enabled coffeepot. It has basic setup instructions, many pages of “making the perfect brew,” and a handful of troubleshooting procedures. However, there are no instances of how the device interacts with other devices on the network. Although the manual states the device is connected and operated via the company’s app you download on a mobile, there is no visible expression as to how the device uses your network, the key element of the device (aside from the core mechanics). At the end of their EULA posted on their website, Behmor states they “may collect and use information gathered in any manner as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the Behmor App. Behmor, Inc.” (Behmor). Of course, this specifically phrased statement of “data collection” leaves a massive grey area, especially in terms of “gathered in any manner.” Though the violation of personal privacy for corporate gain tugs at the collar of every person on the globe, the inept nature of humans in this day in age is to set and forget. In the Behmor example, the devices immediately in contact are the coffeemaker and the mobile device connected via the app. There is, of course, the connection to the internet via a wireless access point, a router, a modem, and voila. A minimum of three other devices are connected to the coffeemaker. Again, from the modem comes the connection to the Internet Service Provider, and down the rabbit hole. Without specifics, it is safe to conclude the data intended to transfer between the coffeemaker and the phone is required to pass through multiple “unrelated” channels, each with their own documentation of usage, each recording information, most of which will be handled elsewhere at the provider’s will.

      Thus begs the question: should consumers be provided full knowledge of how their devices operate on a network, regardless of their technical literacy? The unwilling individual, who ignores the Terms of Service statements and blindly agrees to End User License Agreements, would see such documentation as simply “package filler,” and most often throw it away with little care on the matter. In relation to an ethical theory, utilitarianism, more specifically action relative, comes into play. The willingness of the individual has direct impact on the security of not only their own systems, but the systems of others. With technology, explicit information be provided, and basic security standards should be implemented on the end user. More specifically, the ability to disable remote connection, to set device passwords for connecting, and to view the current processes in operation. To elaborate on the importance of viewing current processing, in 2016, thousands of devices connected to the Internet were employed in a botnet, Mirai. Mirai was used to temporarily disable some major websites, like Spotify, Netflix and Paypal (Norton). The attack used the processing power of the devices to act as a distributed denial of service, DDoS, something the typical owner of the device would be left totally unaware of. Computers with operating systems that include monitoring software, such as Window’s Task Manager feature, can see current processes in operation and the resources being used. For devices lacking in user interfaces, there is no such feature, and the user is left trusting the factory-implemented security features of the device are enough to withstand outside attack. A majority of common users would lack the technical know-how for security their home network aside from a tutorial online, thus leaving the case of whether or not device manufacturers should include additional documentation concerning network interaction to their devices. With this, a greater implementation of “everybody working together” and the expectation of people playing their part, would not only increase global cyber security in the Internet of Things, but aid in the fight against attacks online.

    <p>With additional documentation as to how devices operate on networks comes increased versatility of people’s home network security. Manufacturers might have incentives to increase their built-in security as a marketing ploy, something that should come standard but is seriously lacking. Media outlets proclaim the dangers of network connected devices, such as “Hacked Home Devices Can Spy On You” from NBC, or “A hacker took over a baby monitor and broadcast threats” by the Washington Post. You would think with such a public outcry, the demand for better security would be greater, and the demand of information on how these wifi-connected home devices operate would increase. Yet, it is simple and sad to state the majority of common users would rather set and forget their devices, and live in fantasy, assuming their gadgets and devices are as secure as the locks on their front door. It is more common to find open printers and unprotected networks than an unlocked door, an open window, or a key under the welcome mat. With the inclusion of more devices comes the increased attack surface area, a liability to the homeowner, the ironic duet of increased physical security at the cost of nonphysical security. The best course of action for the implementation of better security should be the public presentation of device operations, the methods of security a device, and the documentation in relation.
