      <p>Act utilitarianism in “Ethics for the Information Age” by Michael J. Quinn exemplifies that the pros often outweigh the cons of a particular action so long as it brings the greatest happiness to all parties.  Quinn also adds that these parties or “beings” are chosen.</p>
      <p>One such example of this in the modern world involves the advanced technology in SmartTV’s that can record your every conversation and give information to so-called trusted third parties.  According to an article on Verge.com called “Lawmakers ask FTC to investigate smart TV privacy concerns,” this was brought to the attention of two senators that wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Center (FTC) saying:</p>
      <p>“Televisions have entered a new era, but that does not mean that users’ sensitive information no longer deserves protection.  The content consumers watch is private, and it should not be assumed that customers want companies to track and use information on their viewing habits.” – Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal (Smith)</p>

      <h2 class="subheader">EPIC vs. Samsung</h2>
      <p>In addition to this, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has also voiced their concerns in a formal complaint to the FTC specifically on Samsung’s collection of data.  This is another great example of the act utilitarianist belief.</p>
      <p>“When the voice recognition feature is enabled, everything a user says in front of the Samsung SmartTV is recorded and transmitted over the internet to a third party regardless of whether it is related to the provision of the service.” (EPIC) </p>
      <p>They even reference Samsung data collection on children.  The concerning factor here is that while EPIC has filed this very informative complaint, FTC has still yet to investigate.</p>
      <h2 class="subheader">Vizio vs. FTC</h2>
      <p>Vizio just failed epically.  Most SmartTV manufacturers allow the user to opt-in or opt-out but Vizio didn’t have an opt-out feature.  Instead, they tracked and shared over 11 million users information with third parties for two years before the FTC finally stepped in.  Vizio ended up having to settle that dispute for a whopping $2.2 million dollars. (Kastrenakes, Jacob)</p>
